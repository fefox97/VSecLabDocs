# Model Extensibility

The MACM model has been designed to support extensibility and customization according to the specific technological domains and use cases.
This section illustrates an example of model extension by introducing support for MQTT-related assets and protocols. These elements are intentionally omitted from the default configuration and added here to demonstrate the flexibility of the modeling framework.
New asset types, protocols, parameters, and dependencies can be seamlessly integrated without altering the core semantics of the model.

**MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth are critical. MQTT operates at the application layer of the OSI model and typically runs over TCP as the underlying transport protocol.

MQTT defines two primary roles in its communication model:

- **Broker**: A central server that receives messages published by clients and forwards them to the appropriate subscribers based on *topics*. The broker manages client sessions, subscriptions, and message delivery semantics such as Quality of Service levels.
- **Client**: Any device or application that connects to the broker to either publish messages to specific topics or subscribe to topics of interest to receive relevant messages. Clients can be highly constrained devices such as sensors, actuators, or more powerful systems such as gateways and servers.

The communication between clients and the broker occurs over a persistent TCP connection. MQTT supports different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) to accommodate varying reliability requirements, making it particularly well-suited for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication scenarios.

## Primary and Secondary Labels

The initial consideration should be the potential expansion of the Primary and Secondary Label sets. In the context of MQTT, we identify two novel assets: the Broker and the Client. Both entities comprise two `Service`s, necessitating no additions to the set $L_P$. Notably, we can classify both the Broker and the Clients as `SaaS`, implying that the set $L_S$ should not be expanded either.

## Asset Types

Let us now consider the potential definition of new Asset Types, to be added to the default ones. In particular, we define two new Asset Types, `Service.MQTTBroker` and `Service.MQTTClient`, which respectively represent an MQTT Broker and an MQTT Client.
Therefore, we define the extended set of asset types as:

$$
\mathbb{T} \leftarrow \mathbb{T} \cup \{ \texttt{Service.MQTTBroker},\; \texttt{Service.MQTTClient} \}
$$

The extension of the asset types is shown in the following table:

| ID | Primary Label | Secondary Label | Name                | Description                                         |
|----|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 49 | Service       | SaaS            | Service.MQTTBroker  | An MQTT broker service for IoT device communication. |
| 50 | Service       | SaaS            | Service.MQTTClient  | An MQTT client service for IoT device communication. |

## Relationships

As for relationships, this extension does not require the addition of new relationships or new parameters.
However, since this is an extension relating to a network protocol, it is required to add that protocol among those supported. In particular, it is a protocol belonging to the application OSI level.
We extend the core sets and mappings as follows to integrate support for MQTT.

- **Protocol Set:**

  $$
  \mathcal{P} \leftarrow \mathcal{P} \cup \{ \texttt{MQTT} \}
  $$

- **Protocol-to-Layer Mapping:**

  $$
  \texttt{ProtocolLayerMapping} \leftarrow \texttt{ProtocolLayerMapping} \cup \{ (\texttt{MQTT}, \texttt{Application}) \}
  $$

- **Protocol-to-Relation Mapping:**

  $$
  \texttt{ProtocolRelationMapping} \leftarrow \texttt{ProtocolRelationMapping} \cup \{ (\texttt{MQTT}, \texttt{uses}) \}
  $$

- **Protocol Semantics Triples:**

  $$
  \texttt{ProtocolSemantics} \leftarrow \texttt{ProtocolSemantics} \cup \{ (\texttt{MQTT}, \texttt{Application}, \texttt{uses}) \}
  $$

The extension of the supported protocols table with the MQTT protocol is as follows:

| ID | Name  | Extended Name | Description                                              | ISO/OSI Layer | Relationship |
|----|-------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 26 | MQTT  | Message Queuing Telemetry Transport | Lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices. | Application    | uses         |

As for any dependencies on the protocols, in this case the MQTT protocol requires TCP as transport protocol. Therefore, updates are required for the `ProtocolDependencies` set, as shown below:

| High-Level Protocol ($p_h$) | Required Key ($k_l$)      | Required Protocol ($p_l$) |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| TLS                        | transport_protocol        | TCP                      |
| DTLS                       | transport_protocol        | UDP                      |
| MQTT                       | transport_protocol        | TCP                      |

## Constraints

The integration of MQTT support requires enforcing additional syntactic constraints to guarantee consistent communication patterns. These constraints ensure that MQTT clients are correctly associated with brokers and that the protocol properties are explicitly defined.

### Syntactic Constraint: MQTT client pattern requirement

If the MACM model includes a node of type `Service.MQTTClient`, then it must also contain a node of type `Service.MQTTBroker` and a `uses` relationship from the client to the broker, with the `application_protocol` parameter set to `MQTT`.

Formally:

$$
\forall n_c \in N, \quad \texttt{AssetType}(n_c) = \texttt{Service.MQTTClient} \Rightarrow
\exists n_b \in N,\; e \in E
$$
such that:

$$
\texttt{AssetType}(n_b) = \texttt{Service.MQTTBroker}
$$
$$
e = (n_c, \texttt{uses}, n_b, P_e) \quad \text{and} \quad (\texttt{application\_protocol}, \texttt{MQTT}) \in P_e
$$
